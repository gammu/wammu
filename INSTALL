Wammu installation
==================

Packages for Linux
==================

Many distributions come with prebuilt Wammu binaries, if you can use
them, it is definitely the easiest thing. There are also binary packages
of latest release built for many distributions available on Wammu web
site <http://wammu.eu/download/wammu/>.


Building from Sources
=====================

It uses standard distutils, so:

    python setup.py build
    sudo python setup.py install

You need python-gammu and wxPython [1] (Unicode enabled build) installed to
run and install this program. If you want support for scanning Bluetooth
devices, you need PyBluez [2]. For incoming events notifications, you
need dbus-python [3].

For Windows you also have to install Pywin32 [4].

If you want to obey dependency checking at build time for any reason,
you can use --skip-deps option.

[2]: http://code.google.com/p/pybluez/

Cross compilation for Windows on Linux
======================================

You need Wine with installed all dependencies (see above section where
to get them).

Building installer for wammu for Python is easy:

    wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps bdist_wininst

However this way user needs to also install all dependencies, what is
really not comfortable. This should be solved using py2exe [5]:

    wine c:\\python25\\python setup.py build --skip-deps py2exe

But except of this, you need to do a bit of manual tuning. To make
py2exe work in Wine, you need to fix it's binary using PE Tools
(described in bug report on Wine [w1]) and copy some extra libraries
which are missing to dist directory (python25.dll and libraries from
wxPython). See script admin/make-release which automates this copying.

Then you can use InnoSetup[6] to build installer for Wammu:

    wine c:\\Program\ Files\\Inno\ Setup\ 5/\\ISCC.exe wammu.iss
